  The Tick is a parasite, and operates in DCP as a both a worker and client.
  It sucks slices from the scheduler, and resubmits them for compute
  at a lower price to the same scheduler. Any work which is computed at the lower price is sent to the scheduler
  as a result; we keep the difference in DCC between what we paid to have the slice computed and we were paid
  to do the computation.
